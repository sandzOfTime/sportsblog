### (1)Los Angeles Lakers vs (8)Portland Trailblazers

The Lakers head into the playoffs as the favorite coming out of the West, led by perennial MVP candidate and self-proclaimed GOAT, Lebron James and DPOY candidate, Anthony Davis. They were only 3-5 in the bubble, but I wouldn't worry about that too much, as they still locked up the number 1 seed and have a good portion of their roster healthy. One player the will miss is Avery Bradley, who is a big reason why the Lakers have the 3rd ranked [defense](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/2020.html) in the league. To replace him, they went out and got JR Smith, Dion Waiters and promising rookie Talen Horton-Tucker. Eventually, one of these guys is going to have to play big if the Lakers want to hold that trophy when it's all said and done.

Portland enters the postseason as the hottest team in the bubble(outside of Phoenix). They'll be ready to go out of the gate, having finished 6-2 since the restart. Damian Lillard has been a man on a mission, averaging 37.6(!!) points in the bubble. Everything starts and ends with Dame, but he's got a good amount of help since the season resumed. Gary Trent Jr proved to be a reliable shooter (50% from 3 in 8 games) and defender off the bench, and expect him to play a lot in this series, and even get reps guarding Lebron. Getting back Jusuf Nurkic is huge. He's a big body who can pass, score in the post and is a high IQ player who knows how to use his size on both sides of the ball. The Blazers are peaking at the right time and will be ready for this matchup.

Los Angeles has had a problem defending dynamic point guards all season. I don't expect this series to be any different. Dame will get his, the question is how much can the others contribute. CJ Mccollum, who's dealing with an injured back, will have to step up big time and provide Dame with a consistent second option. The other question Portland has to ask themselves is who the hell is guarding Lebron and AD? The Blazers have no true wings in their playoff rotation (both Melo and Hezonja are better off as small-ball fours) and the Lebron/AD pick-and-roll should be able to provide mismatches from all over the floor.

I say that to say, I don't expect Portland to have much of chance in this series. Yes, Dame is amazing. Yes, they did go 6-2 in the bubble. But out of those 8 games played, 6 were decided by 5 points or [less](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/POR/2020_games.html) while Dame averaged an insane 42 minutes in those contests. That's not to mention that most of the opposing teams either reduced their stars' minutes, or chose not to play them altogether. Playing against a Lakers team that has two players that can be the best player on the floor each night, the margin of error is too small for Portland to consistently win. Portland has not shown that they can survive three minutes with Dame on the bench against regular teams. Against the number one seed in the West, he may have to play all 48 just for them to even have a chance.


##### Prediction: Lakers in 5


### (2) Los Angeles Clippers vs (7) Dallas Mavericks

Even though they missed players due to injuries and other personal matters (S/O Magic City!), the Clippers enter the playoffs with the most to potential out of any team in the league. For starters, they have the 5th ranked defense and 2nd ranked [offense](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAC/2020.html).They also have arguably the deepest roster in the league, with the mid-season additions of Marcus Morris (averaging 20 points per game before being traded to Los Angeles) and Reggie Jackson. Oh yeah, and they did all of this despite only having that deep roster fully available for seven [games](https://www.nba.com/first-round-playoff-series-preview-clippers-mavericks-2020). Paul George and Kawhi Leonard lead the way (both averaged 25 points during the restart) and once everyone gets back, they should have enough to make a deep run.


Dallas enters with the most efficient offense in league history, by the numbers. Led by star sophomore Luka Doncic(who averaged 30/10/10 since the restart) and Kristaps Porzingis (who also averaged 30 in the bubble), the Mavs have a promising young duo to build around for years to come. How quickly they rise to elite status in the West depends on how fast they grow up. A big test for them will be how they handle this first round matchup.

All eyes will be on Luka from the start. Expect the Clippers to give him different looks with multiple defenders (Patrick Beverly, PG, Kawhi). Although I still expect Luka to play well, I wouldn't be surprised if his efficiency takes a huge drop because of the number of tough coverages that he'll face. That means that Porzingis will have to bring that same production to the postseason. Also, despite having the most efficient offense in the league, the Mavericks have still struggled to close games. That task will only get tougher with the amount of physical defenders that the Clippers can use in the half-court. On the Clippers' side, there is a question of how well we expect them to play together. Again, this will be the first time in a long time that they've competed with a semi full roster. Will there be any chemistry issues?  During the season series, the Clippers swept this matchup 3-0. While I don't expect Dallas to win, I expect them to make it a bit more competitive as the Clippers still try to figure out their identity in the earlier rounds.


##### Prediction: Clippers in 6



### (3) Denver Nuggets vs (6) Utah Jazz

 {{< figure src="https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/ReCRW3kpz4SMv2XK1WmQOjaih3I=/0x600/smart/filters:quality(86)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/KAQWMZYDIVATBDLFDQYYNGNBAY.jpg">}}

The Nuggets enter this series with probably the most interesting team within the bubble, having gone 4-4 since the restart. To start, they ramped up Michael Porter Jr's minutes, going from 14 a game before the restart to 33 a [game](https://stats.nba.com/players/traditional/?sort=MIN&dir=-1&Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&DateFrom=07%2F30%2F2020&DateTo=11%2F01%2F2020) in the bubble. They've also gotten solid and unexpected minutes from Bol Bol, who looks the part as a key piece of their future, but might not yet be ready to completely change a playoff game. They still have All-NBA center Nikola Jokic and emerging star Jamal Murray. It will be interesting to see how much of an impact Porter Jr (who averaged 22 in the Bubble), will continue to have on an already potent offense (ranked 10th in the league).

Utah also has an All-NBA caliber center in Rudy Gobert, a two-time DPOY who's looking to nab his third. They only went 3-5 since the restart, but its not a stretch to say that they probably tanked a few of those games to avoid playing Houston in the first round because of their previous postseason history (Houston eliminated Utah in the last two playoffs). Mike Conley is starting to play well after starting the season poorly. And Donovan Mitchell continues to improve and provide offense for a team that's really lacking after losing Bojan Bogdanovic to injury.


Despite Gobert being an excellent rim protector, this is the first time in 5 years that Utah does not have a top 10 defense (13th). A lot of this has to do with the fact that teams are starting to figure out something that Houston figured out the last two playoffs; you can exploit the Jazz's defense when you can pull Gobert away from the rim and make him guard shooters. Will Denver make enough shots from the outside to scramble Utah's defense? Also, how will the injuries to Will Barton and Gary Harris affect Denver's depth? The key matchup will obviously be the battle in the middle. Jokic dominated the regular season matchup between the two bigs, averaging basically a 30 point triple double when they played the Jazz and winning all three matchups. Can Utah find a way to slow him down?

This series is one of the more difficult ones to pick. The teams are evenly matched and it should honestly come down to whichever team executes better down the stretch. Because I believe in Jokic's decision making at the end of games, I'll give the very slight advantage to Denver.


##### Prediction: Nuggets in 7




### (4) Houston Rockets vs (5) Oklahoma City Thunder

 {{< figure src="https://sports.inquirer.net/files/2020/01/AP20010112700085.jpg">}}


Houston enters the playoffs as one of the biggest wildcards in the NBA. They finished Bubble play at 4-4 with James Harden torching opponents as usual, averaging 35 points to go along with 9 rebounds and 9 assists. They have continued to get good contributions from their bench and supporting players(including Austin Rivers, who had 41 in a game earlier in the restart). And Russell Westbrook has looked comfortable in his role playing off of Harden. After suffering an injury to his quad though, we may be getting a limited Russ in this series.

OKC is also playing great basketball behind Chris Paul, a guy many consider to still be the ultimate floor general. Their three-point-guard lineup with Paul, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Dennis Schroeder is running teams off of the floor. And Steven Adams is still beast down low; averaging almost a double - double, while adding a career high in assists (2.3 a game).

This matchup will probably be the most entertaining and competitive matchup of the first round. There are so many storylines at play here, starting with the two future HOF point guards facing off against their old teams. While OKC may still have a lot of love for Russ, the same can't be said about how Houston feels about CP3. The big question for Houston is, can small-ball work, and can Houston's lineup impose their will on this series? The lineup itself allows for Houston to switch a lot of defensive assignments and gives Russ free reign on offense to terrorize teams inside (he's having a career year in points in the paint). However, sacrificing size comes at a cost, and it will make Houtson more vulnerable inside for offensive rebounds and second chance points (Adams is 5th in the NBA in offensive rebounds). How much you believe in Houston will depend on whether or not you believe that they will shoot it well enough for the amount of attempts that they take (they rank 1st in 3-point attempts, but just 24th in 3-point percentage). Also, will an injured Russ be able to compete at a high level, considering so much of his game relies on his athleticism? 

Personally, I do feel as if Westbrook not being fully healthy will play a factor in this series. But despite that, even if he was healthy, I wouldn't feel totally comfortable about the Rockets pick. Houston obviously has more star power and their belief in their identity and style of play is a good thing. However, I think the overall depth of OKC and their size advantage will give them an edge. I also would rather trust CP with the ball in his hands at the end of a game, compared to Russ (who's never been a good decision maker) or Harden (who just hasn't fully used his talents to find easier shots down the stretch).



##### Prediction: Thunder in 7
