I hear people tell each other all the time to pursue their "passion". I kind of get it, but it never really sat well with me.
<!--more-->

Here's the thing; people can be passionate about so many things. I remember when I was a young boy, I thought I was passionate about being a drummer. I spent time thinking I would be playing in bands all over the world, travelling with other artists and making music of my own. But that wasn't anything realistic. Not because I couldn't do it, but because drumming never consumed me.


From the first moment I picked up a basketball, I fell in love with the game. It was something that I could imagine myself playing for the rest of my life. I've been blessed to have played the game at different levels (high school and college). During that time, I've had moments of triumph and defeat. I've had peaks and valleys. Tears of joy one day and pain the next. Anybody who's played a sport before, or given a lot to anything in life can relate. Through it all, the game never left. Even when I became sidelined with injuries, my love off the court grew even more. I spent hours watching highlights of some of the game's very best. I can't even begin to quantify the amount of time I wasted scouring through blogs and arguing with randoms (doesn't that also make me a random?) about topics neither of us would ever agree on. The devotion that I had in those instances is still something that I've had a hard time explaining. But it's for that reason, that I've redefined what passion means to me. Passion isn't only the things that you dream about. It's tapping into the things that you can't really live without.

This wasn't meant to be some sort of inspirational post. However, long story short, the game means a lot to me, so I'm hoping to use this platform to show that.

 Here's what you can expect:
 I'll be writing about the NBA to anybody who'll listen (or read, in this case). And also, because I'm an irrational Knicks fan I'll be discussing the NBA draft, considering we're almost always in the lottery. I also want to get into some G-league because there are a lot of hoopers in there that don't get nearly the exposure they deserve. More importantly, I look forward to having discussions where we all could appreciate, analyze and critque all aspects about the game we love. 
 
 If that stuff interests you, then subscribe. 
 
And even if it doesnt, I hope reading this encourages you to not ignore the things in life that you can't live without.

 Much love,
 Sandzo
