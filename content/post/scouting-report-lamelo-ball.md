Ever since the 2017 draft, when his older brother Lonzo got selected, Lamelo and the rest of the Ball family has been under a larger than life media microscope. This was mainly due to their outspoken father, Lavar. It seems that so much has changed since then (the rise and [fall](https://foxsportsradio.iheart.com/content/2019-07-17-lavar-balls-big-baller-brand-appears-to-heading-towards-bankruptcy/) of the  BBB, the Facebook [reality](https://www.facebook.com/ballinthefamily/) series, and Gelo behind [bars](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/11/07/liangelo-ball-and-two-other-ucla-players-reportedly-arrested-in-china-for-shoplifting/) etc.)
<!--more--> 
Fast forward to now, and what you have is a different reality from what most would've expected. Lonzo has underperformed compared to his [unrealistic](https://www.nba.com/article/2017/06/23/magic-johnson-los-angeles-lakers-have-high-expectations-lonzo-ball) expectations (although he's still a good player). The middle brother, Liangelo,  is currently playing for the G-League team in OKC after being pulled from UCLA due to a much publicized shoplifting incident. And then there is Lamelo, the projected number one pick in the 2020 draft after a brief stint playing in Australia. Lavar has gone on record and said that he believes Lamelo is the best out of all the brothers. If so, what does that mean for his NBA future?

I went over a few of his games in the NBL (Austrailia's top basketball league) and here's some thoughts that I came away with.


### He will enter the NBA as one of the league's best passers

If it's one thing that Lamelo has in common with his older brother Lonzo (he actually has more than one thing in common), it's his ability to pass the rock. Both Ball brothers share an innate ability to find the open man without needing to dominate the ball or without having to bend the defense in crazy ways. Lamelo, in particular, has a way of seeing plays before they actually happen. Not only that, he does a good job of reading and reacting to changing defenses on the fly. Watch how, instead of taking a layup, he changes his mind at the last second to find a teammate streaking to the rim, who quite frankly, didn't even expect to be in this play:

<br>

<br>

<br>

For Lamelo, this is like clock-work. He averaged 6.8 assists per game in the NBL, which was rated second in the entire league. While most of these plays are flashy, it's the creativity that he uses that stands out the most. To be an elite passer at the next level, there needs to be a certain level of flair for the dramatics. And it also takes real precision to be able to squeeze the right passes in such tight spaces. Case in point, look at how crisp this behind the back bounce pass is,  and the gap that he squeezed it through after coming off the side PnR. 

<br>

{{< youtube id="KTDZGQ0qb_s?start=39" autoplay="false" >}}

<br>

<br>

From the naked eye, it just looks like a fancy pass. But if that was just a regular bounce pass, instead of a behind the back one, it probably ends up as a kickball at best, or a turnover at worst. A lot of superstar players can make every shot in the book and that play is a good example of how Lamelo can make just about every pass you can think of. 

<br>

Another part of his game that boosts his passing ability is his advanced handle. One issue that has held back Lonzo since he came in the league has been a lack of ability to break his man down off the dribble. By just looking at the eye test, there is a vast difference in how both brothers can attack guys off the bounce whether in isolation, or in pick and roll scenarios. Lamelo uses an array of hang dribbles, crossovers and hesitations to get past his man or split picks easily. Watch how he's able to split this pick with a behind the back dribble and immediately turn that into a behind the back pass for the dime.

<br>

<br>



Think for a second and ask yourself, how many point guards in the league can pull off that move with a pass all-in-one motion? 5 or maybe 6? That is a type of play that you only see from the truly elite playmakers in the league and I feel that Lamelo has a chance to enter that discussion from day one.



### His natural ball instincts are elite

In a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyBqX-c_kls&t=1016s) breakdown that took place late last year, Mike Schmitz sat down with Lamelo and guessed that a lot of Lamelo's natural feel for the game came from playing a lot of backyard basketball (Knockout, horse, etc) with his brothers when they were younger. Watching Lamelo play, you can tell that he has a feel that could only be achieved by hooping a lot and by trying out different things. His ability to generate plays by knowing how to be in the right position at the right time is pretty remarkable. He is also able to adjust to different situations depending on where he is on the floor. Take this example during a preseason game where he is posted up by a bigger player. He has the peace of mind to time the offensive player's dribbles and "pull the chair" just as he's about to make his move while also getting a swipe at the ball.

<br>

{{< youtube id="r9Eld47J7wc?start=6247" autoplay="false" >}}

<br>

<br>Most would call this a veteran move. What impressed me the most while watching this in real time, was that he didn't think twice about doing it even though it wasn't a position he had been put in the whole game. That means that play was driven completely off of instinct.

He also uses his instincts to jump passing lanes and rack up steals. Lamelo averaged about 1.7 steals, which ranked 2nd in the NBL (and would rank around 6th or 7th in the NBA this past season). His quick hands and IQ allow him to not only see plays ahead offensively, but he can also make reads on the defensive side of the ball as well.

<br>

{{< youtube id="pM4kTfMP4oc?start=2487" autoplay="false" >}}

<br>

<br>

If you look at the NBA steals leaderboard, you'll see names such as Ben Simmons, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard and Fred Vanvleet. At the very least, those are all high IQ players and some of them; really great defenders. Of course, generating steals doesn't necessarily mean great defense, and on that end, Lamelo leaves a lot to be desired. He rarely gives effort on a lot of plays and has a rather lackadaisical approach most of the time. I do believe though, with his height (listed at 6'7), length and overall IQ, he won't be a zero on that end of the floor and with the right coach, he could turn into a solid team defender.



### Scoring efficiently will be a problem for him

A lot of early memories of Lamelo stem from his high school days as a designated bucket getter, playing alongside his two older brothers at Chino Hills. Many may remember the deep Steph-Curry like 3's he took while there. And who could forget the 92 point [game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn4hK6VIxE) in honor of his friend? Lamelo can score, but the question of how good and how efficient of a scorer he can be is wide open for discussion. Lamelo's counting stats were pretty good in Australia (17.0 ppg, 7.6 rpg, 6.8 apg per [Tankathon](http://www.tankathon.com/players/lamelo-ball)) but his shooting percentages were terrible. He shot sub 40 from the field (37%) and less than 30 from 3 (25%). That all added up to a TS% of 46% (the league average TS% is about 56%). Lamelo only played 13 games so its possible that it's too small of a sample size to draw any real conclusions. But in the games he played, he struggled with poor shot selection and a penchant for avoiding physicality.  Take a look at the shot below.

<br>

{{< youtube id="pM4kTfMP4oc?start=4355" autoplay="false" >}}

<br><br>

On the surface, this doesn't look like a terrible shot. Context is important here though! He had just basically hit two consecutive threes, one off movement and one off the bounce (both impressive) so this was more of a heat check than anything. But Melo has been so statistically bad at these that it's difficult to imagine which coach at the next level would give him free reign when there are possibly better options on the floor.

<br>

{{< youtube id="K29qsdWdAlk?start=843" autoplay="false" >}}

<br>

<br>

Again,  not a good shot given the circumstances. There is plenty of time left on the shot clock and it is such a deep look. We've seen videos of Lamelo shooting from half-court in high school, so it's reasonable to think that this is a shot he can make. But until he gets his reputation up as a shooter, it will be difficult to justify him shooting as many as he has (he was first in 3PA on his team, despite being the 3rd worst shooter percentage wise).



Another thing that I believe will affect how easily he scores is his lack of athleticism. Similar to his older brother Lonzo, Lamelo is entering the league as a limited athlete despite having a really good size for his position (although Lonzo is considerably more athletic). Most elite scoring guards possess either great speed/hops (Russ, Kemba) or elite shot-making (Steph, Dame, Trae, CP3 etc). Although Lamelo is still very young (would still be 18 on draft day), he doesn't quite have a solid base in any of these facets. His lack of athleticism and strength show up in this play.

<br>

{{< youtube id="pM4kTfMP4oc?start=3989" autoplay="false" >}}

<br>

<br>

Watch how easily he gets bottled up on this play, before he even reaches the rim. Although he's taller than his defender (fellow prospect RJ Hampton), he doesn't have the athleticism to rise with him or the strength to body him and get off a clean look.



<br>

{{< youtube id="B-wzqCiLazc?start=12" autoplay="false" >}}

<br>

<br>

He makes the shot on this play, but the degree of difficulty on this one is still very high. Lamelo has shown the ability and touch to make floaters and nifty scoop layups, but even then, you would like to see a guy with his size be able to get all the way to the rim here and not rely so heavily on shots mostly reserved for smaller guards. 

That doesn't mean that he has to be the fastest player or the best shooter to have a major impact scoring wise. Luka Doncic (who I think is probably the absolute ceiling for a guy like Lamelo), isn't necessarily the best shooter (shooting just 32% from deep) or the quickest guy, but he does make up for it by getting to the free throw line - A LOT (he's 4th in the league in free throw attempts and had a free throw rate of 50% pre-draft). By comparison, Lamelo has a free throw rate of 24%. Maybe added strength will be the trick to help Lamelo draw contact better. Time will tell. In any event, there is a lot of cleaning up he has to do in his game if he wants to become a more dependable scorer.



### What to expect in the NBA?

I think most people would agree that Lamelo is probably the most divisive player in the 2020 draft class. I've said before that I believe he's probably the most talented freshman-level guard that I've seen since Kyrie Irving. His mix of passing ability, handles , touch and size is not rivaled by any other prospect this year. In fact, some of the plays that he makes on a game to game basis, can't be duplicated by even some of the game's very best. For that reason alone, most of the hype that he receives is warranted. I do think he'll easily end up as the best Ball brother in the long run. 

However, even with that being said, it's difficult for me to say that he should be the consensus #1 pick. He has loads of talent, but his ability to score the ball leaves a lot to be desired for an overall #1 pick. Usually guys selected that high, are tasked with being "the man" on their team and Lamelo has just not proven to be that efficient to where I believe he can carry that burden.  In addition to that, watching him play, you don't get the sense that you are watching a guy who is comfortable being an "alpha", which is what you absolutely want out of your franchise player. Lamelo has a joy for playing the game, he is very laid back and he loves to have fun on the court, but it remains to be seen whether or not he loves to dominate his opponent. This is what separates the talented players from the superstars.

In a normal draft class, he probably would be selected around 3 or 4. But because this is projected to be a weak draft, I can understand selecting him as high as #1, in hopes that he irons out his shot selection and the right coaching staff can get him to dial up his intensity from start to finish. In the end though, it's important not to overthink the type of talent that he is. There are only three 6'8 point guards in the NBA (Lebron, Luka and Ben Simmons) and all of them are all-stars. Lamelo will be the 4th. And while It's not a guarantee (nor do I think) that he will end up as good as any of those three, almost any team that walks away with him on draft night should feel comfortable that he can be their franchise PG for years to come.

How good do you think Lamelo will be? Share your thoughts in the comments and lets discuss.
