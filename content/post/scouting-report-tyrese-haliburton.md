The 2020 NBA draft is filled with a ton of dynamic guards.

While all of them bring something different to the table, none of them are more intriguing to me than Tyrese Haliburton, the sophmore guard out of Iowa State. 
<!--more--> 


After receiving only four [offers](https://www.theringer.com/2019/11/27/20984769/tyrese-haliburton-iowa-state-nba-draft-prospect) and being heavily under-recruited in high school, Haliburton has put himself in a position two years later, to be possibly selected as a top-5 pick. A lot of that has to do with his effective style of play, and the nature of the pro game today. Today's brand of basketball is a game of numbers, and Haliburton is basically the prototype of that. Standing at 6'5, this past season, he averaged 15.2 points, 5.9 rebounds, 6.5 assists, shooting just above 50%. Beyond the numbers, he's a versatile guard that can guard about three positions, he's unselfish and has the tools to play both on and off the ball.

But despite having an overall great profile, there are mixed feelings about him as a prospect/player. Depending on who's talking, many experts have him getting drafted anywhere from 3rd to 15th. I watched a few of his games to figure out why there are so many different opinions on him, and how good could he really be at the NBA. Here's what I saw:


### He always finds the open man

Recently I wrote about [Lamelo](https://www.sandstalkshoops.com/post/scouting-report-lamelo-ball/) and how I felt he is so good at reading and making the right plays. Haliburton in my eyes takes that to a next level. In most of the games I've watched of him, I can't recall one time during those games where he didn't try to make the right play or read, even if it didn't end up in a made basket. He doesn't look teammates off (sometimes, I wish he would), will find the open man if he sees him and he rarely ever forces plays. In a lot of ways, he reminds me more of Lonzo Ball than his actual brother. Here's him finding an open teammate off the pick and roll.

<br>

The teammate didn't hit the shot, but this is as good of a look as he could get. What is just as impressive is how quickly Haliburton was able to make that pass after his first option had been cut off. His quick thinking allows him to make these kinds of passes and plays regularly. Haliburton is a pass first guard, even by his own [admission](https://www.theringer.com/2019/11/27/20984769/tyrese-haliburton-iowa-state-nba-draft-prospect). His scoring more than doubled from his freshman to sophmore year, but that was mostly because he was asked to shoot more. But he can't get away from what he loves and he loves to make his teammates better.

<br>

This is another example. Once again, it's a simple play, but you can see how good his vision and timing is on these types of passes. He used a slight hesitation to freeze #12's man, before whipping it back to him for the open 3. The shot doesn't drop here, but in the NBA, that's 3 points almost automatic. Plays like this, speak to the type of player he is and his unselfishness.

It also speaks to some challenges he's gonna face at the next level in terms of when to make a play for himself vs when to make one for someone else. Sure, making the "right" play almost all the time is an ability that most players either don't have or don't use. But what if the nature of the game dictates that he "force" the issue a little bit more rather than just passing it to the open guy?

<br>

{{< youtube id="TJb6FyHnzgc?start=2881" autoplay="false" >}}

<br>

In a game like this where they are down almost 20, it would be good to see him try to take command of that possession and make sure that they get a good shot rather than just giving it to the guy because he's open. Is it a good, unselfish play? Sure. But it still feels like settling on his part. On this Iowa State team, he's the clear cut best player. Although he isn't dominating the ball every time down the floor (he has only the 5th highest [usage](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/iowa-state/2020.html) rate on the team), it would be good to see him taking control in situations like that.


### He has an ugly form, but the shot goes in

Haliburton, like Lonzo, will enter the league with one of the more weird, inconsistent forms in recent memory. It's sort of like a set shot. He hitches it to the right side of his face and indistinctly "pauses" before he ends up releasing. He doesn't get off the ground either. But make no mistake, the shot drops. And it drops often.

<br>

<br>

As weird as the form is, it's effective. Haliburton shot 42% from 3 on a high number of attempts (he shot 43% his freshman year). He also shot really well from the free throw line (82%). Most good coaches will tell you that your shooting form doesn't have to be perfect. And what's most important, is that you perfect your shooting form. The key to perfecting it will be if he can continuously hit these kinds of shots off the dribble.

<br>

{{< youtube id="hgaPZtizP-E?start=180" autoplay="false" >}}

<br>

Here, the form doesn't really look the same as his regular set shots. He doesn't take much of these though. Does he feel comfortable shooting these as much as he does regular set shots? Time will tell.  Lonzo faced similar questions when coming out of UCLA, and so far, he hasn't quite figured out the shooting aspect of his game (although he did shoot a career high from 3 this past season). The difference with Hali is he has a longer track [record](https://www.theringer.com/2019/11/27/20984769/tyrese-haliburton-iowa-state-nba-draft-prospect) of being a good shooter.  What will turn him into a great shooter is whether or not, he can make those types of shots from all over the court.



### He's going to have scoring struggles

In the last article, I [mentioned](https://www.sandstalkshoops.com/post/scouting-report-lamelo-ball/) how I felt Lamelo would have trouble scoring efficiently at the NBA level. Well, Lamelo might actually look like Kyrie compared to Haliburton. Don't get me wrong, Haliburton is an extremely efficient basketball player (63 [TS%](http://www.tankathon.com/players/tyrese-haliburton), which would be like first among guard prospects this year). That's mostly because he plays a mistake-free brand of basketball. He doesn't force bad shots, rarely ever turns over the basketball and always makes the "right play" (see above). With that being said, there are times when you watch him play and wonder if he chooses not to score or he just doesn't have the ability to as much as people would like him to. Take this play for example.

<br>

{{< youtube id="TJb6FyHnzgc?start=961" autoplay="false" >}}

<br>

I think it's two ways you can look at a play like this. On one hand, he definitely picked up his dribble too quickly, and could have made a move to attack the big early once he got the switch. On the other hand, he received a soft trap that could have played into his thinking, to find the open man. Whatever the situation is, there were a lot of his possessions that ended up similar to this. 

<br>

{{< youtube id="hgaPZtizP-E?start=432" autoplay="false" >}}

<br>

Even against a matchup he should want (a big switched on him), he bails the defense out by, once again, picking up his dribble so early. This seems to be a common theme with him that I have a problem with, and he does it even when it can lead to good looks. In this case, it's good that he found his teammate posting up a smaller defender, but the shot was so bad of an attempt, you wonder if Haliburton was just better off keeping the ball.



When Haliburton does decide to attack the rim, he's actually a solid finisher around the rim ([64%](https://www.thestepien.com/2020/02/14/tyrese-haliburton-scouting-report/) in the half court). The problem is that he doesn't get there often. He also barely gets to the free throw line (he only averages 2 free throw [attempts](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/tyrese-haliburton-1.html) a game) . Take this play for example.

<br>

{{< youtube id="TJb6FyHnzgc?start=2085" autoplay="false" >}}

<br>

Haliburton does get all the way to the rim here, but settles for an off balance floater, instead of just getting all the way to the rim, to avoid getting hit.  It's no surprise that he doesn't like contact (he only weighs 175lbs and has a slim build in general). But with a funky shooting form already, if he doesn't get to the rim or foul line at a better rate, you have to wonder how much of an impact he will have scoring wise.



### What to expect in the NBA?

At the end of the day, the very best point guards in the NBA today are risk takers and they know not only when to create for others, but they also know when they need to create for themselves. Great point guards are "engines" for their team's offense; and they can control the game by making plays consistently. As good as Haliburton is in many areas of the game, it's difficult seeing him be that type of guard because of his risk-free style of play and tendency to kill his dribble. However, that doesn't mean he still can't be a really good pro. He has plenty of things going well for him (very good passer, active defender, makes his open shots etc). Even though I don't think he's a star guard in the making, he seems like the type of guy that could thrive alongside one if given the opportunity. Depending on what team drafts him, he could probably end up as one of the more safer picks in this draft. At the very least, whatever team drafts him is going to get a player that will no doubt help his team win games. As I said before, he reminds me a lot of Lonzo and I think he'll end up as that type of player (with better shooting probably). He may not be a star player, but a great player to have for a really good team.
