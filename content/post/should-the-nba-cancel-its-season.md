It's been 24 days (and counting) since the last NBA regular season games took place due to COVID-19 and for most fans (including me), it feels like much longer.

 Since then, the debate among players, coaches and fans alike has been whether the NBA should resume the season at all or just cut it's losses and cancel it altogether. Growing concerns of the cancellation peaked when ESPN's Brian Windshorst reported that there is ["pessimism"](https://www.espn.com/video/clip?id=28993152) as it relates to the league actually resuming its season. 
 
 But is that the right thing to do?

 A few factors come to mind when I think about how the rest of the season plays out.

 ### Dealing with a shortened season

 One advantage that the league has in this race is that it's dealt with a compromised season before. Most people remember the recent lockout before the 2011-2012 season, which forced the season to be shortened to 66 games(instead of the usual 82). Preceeding that was the lockout in the 1998-1999 season, that saw teams only play 50 games. In both those years, an NBA championship was given out and fans generally don't view those years any differently than standard seasons. There are also people in general that believe the season is too [long](https://www.google.com) in the first place (count me in that number). This could be a golden opportunity for the NBA to finally address that issue. If they could somehow start the playoffs around August, that could push the start of next season to Christmas Day, where you could have a season similar to what happened in 2011. Or maybe they could go in a different direction entirely, and instead decide to push the schedule back for good, so that it always begins in December and ends around August. This [idea](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/hawks-ceo-steve-koonin-proposes-to-start-nba-season-in-december-league-is-open-to-the-idea/) has been proposed before. Whatever they do decide, they have options. 

 Changing the structure of the season won't be pain free though. The NBA is basically a year round league, with things going on even when the season ends. When the playoffs over, teams start preparing for the NBA draft. After the draft, there is Summer league. That's not even counting the hype of free agency. Protecting the main cash cow (the regular season and playoffs) is most important, but no doubt, all these other events play a role in making the league as profitable as possible. Switching the schedule around would affect alot.



 ### Playing without fans?

The topic of playing without fans has been debated from a few people, players and analysts alike. The idea is that the players would be quarantined in a [centralized](https://sports.yahoo.com/nba-playoffs-coronavirus-pandemic-regular-season-playoffs-single-site-041634778.html) location, to limit the chances of them coming into contact with any infected person. Once there, they would play in one venue, without fans, that would end once a champion is crowned. Other leagues have proposed similar ideas. The Big3 league is planning on hosting a "quarantined reality hoops tournament" that would be paired with a reality television [series](https://www.vibe.com/2020/03/ice-cube-big3-quarantined-reality-hoops-tournament). A similar situation is happening in China, where the CBA (Chinese Basketball Association) asked players to report back to China to be placed under a 14 day quaratine before league play would resume, without fans (more on the China situation later). While this seems like a suitable option, there are alot of moving parts involved. To start it off, how would the game look without fans? The face of the league said himself that he's not too [interested](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28958201/no-excitement-fans) in that idea. And honestly, who could blame him? Fans bring a needed element to games that just can't be replaced. Without them, the games would just feel like glorified scrimmages. Home court advantage would essentially be neutralized, and we know how big of a deal that is, once playoff time rolls around. And of course, the league loses out on a ton of revenue in terms of ticket sales and concessions **--**


But while it's tough to imagine how that would look, its understandeable why the NBA, along with other leagues would be so invested in something like that happening. Every day, the league is losing millions of dollars by not playing. Some revenue is better than none and with there being basically a world-wide hiatus on sports, bringing some games back would no doubt attract a large audience and bring in millions of viewers.

As it stands, it will really come down to how safe these games actually are. In theory, putting healthy players in a "bubble" and allowing them to play, practice and compete isolated from anybody else sounds conceivable. But this isn't 2k. These players have family members and loved ones that need their support. And there is always the chance that somehow, one of these players ends up becoming infected and then we are back to square one. **--** 



### Looking at the CBA

Whatever happens in China, figures to be the standard for how sports leagues around the world will resume play.
