After a lot of doubt about whether or not the NBA would return or not (including from [me](https://www.sandstalkshoops.com/post/should-the-nba-cancel-its-season/)), the league is finally back in action and we're getting ready for the playoffs. So far, the restart has been a success as we've seen a few surprises (Phoenix going 8-0, contenders looking vulnerable) as well as some emerging stars (TJ Warren and Michael Porter Jr just to name a few). 
<!--more--> 
We can't forget about guys like Damian Lillard and Devin Booker, who both look ready to take a leap. All of that means that this year's playoffs should be the most interesting that the league has seen in a while. To start it off, there's no such thing as home-court advantage. Will players feel more or less pressure playing in an open gym, compared to thousands of fans cheering or booing them? How will the long layoff affect playoff tested veterans, who may have needed rest, but are essentially in the midst of a totally different season?

Today, I take a look at the matchups in the East, and try to predict how they will play out and what things to watch out for.


### (1)Milwaukee Bucks vs (8)Orlando Magic

 {{< figure src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_736,h_485,c_fill,g_auto,f_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsircharlesincharge.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fgetty-images%2F2017%2F07%2F1208616109-1-850x560.jpeg">}}

No disrespect to Orlando, but this series is all about the Bucks. Milwaukee entered the bubble with the best record in the NBA through 65 games, had the number one [defense](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIL/2020.html), and has a guy that is on pace to win both the MVP and DPOY award (you read that correctly). Despite all of that, they looked beatable inside the bubble, going 3-5 in regular season games with some tough losses against the Rockets, Nets and Mavs. Giannis still is playing at an MVP level, and he should be able to easily control the tempo as the best player in this series.  Add in two-time All Star Khris Middleton, and a solid supporting cast, and the Bucks have enough to make a deep run in the playoffs.

Like Milwaukee, Orlando also finished the bubble with a 3-5 record. But that's where the similarities end. They finished the season 33-40, and at one point they lost 5 straight within the bubble. But they got some things going for them. They have a defense that's ranked in 10th in the league, 6 (healthy) players that are averaging over double figures, and they're coached pretty well. Expect them to put up a fight against Milwaukee, and compete in one or two close games. However, missing Jonathan Issac (their best perimeter defender), will be a huge blow.

During the season, the Bucks swept this matchup 4-0. I expect more of the same unless something magical happens. Losing both Jonathan Issacs and Mo Bamba hurts, as the Magic already don't have anyone that remotely has a chance at checking Giannis. They will have to wall up the paint and hope that the Bucks' outside threats don't beat them (it's possible). But make no mistake, shooting will be a huge factor in this series. The Bucks have the best paint defense in the league, thanks to Giannis and Brook Lopez. However, they've allowed the most wide open 3-pointers out of any other team because of their devotion to protecting the basket. The Magic rank 25th in the NBA in 3-point percentage. In other words, the Bucks allow a lot of wide open threes, and Orlando doesn't have the shooters to make Milwaukee pay for leaving them open. Which means, this series could get ugly quick. At some point, Milwaukee's plan to let teams beat them from three will backfire. But this won't be the series where that happens.



##### Prediction: Bucks in 4.



### (2)Toronto Raptors vs (7)Brooklyn Nets

 {{< figure src="https://images.actionnetwork.com/blog/2020/08/Lowry1200.jpg">}}



The defending champs enter the playoffs with the 2nd ranked defense(behind Milwaukee), and plenty of momentum after going 7-1 in the bubble. Their entire roster is basically healthy with the return of Marc Gasol and they have enough weapons to make life hard for any and every opponent (6 players averaging double figures). Of course, this isn't the same team that won the championship last year. No Kawhi Leonard means the Raptors don't have a genuine shot creator in the half-court. However, they make up for it in other areas (being a dangerous transition team and ranking 2nd in the league in forcing turnovers).

Brooklyn enters this matchup as basically a different team from the one that finished the season 30-34. They were already down Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant. Spencer Dinwiddie also hasnt played a game since the restart and they've added 5 new players basically just to make up the numbers. On top of that, Jacque Vaughn has only been their coach for 10 games. Despite all of this, they still competed at a high level since the restart, going 5-3, led by Caris Levert, who's averaged 25 points in the [bubble](https://stats.nba.com/players/traditional/?sort=PTS&dir=-1&Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&DateFrom=07%2F30%2F2020&DateTo=11%2F01%2F2020) (ranked 12th among all players) on 48% shooting.

The Nets can score and have done plenty of that since the bubble has restarted(putting up 120 a night). Something to watch this series will be the play of Levert. If he continues to play at a high level, the Nets probably have a chance of pushing this series to six games. But, the Raptors do have enough bodies and defenders to make his life very difficult. You can make an argument that no one in the Raptors starting 5 is a liability defensively. If that's the case, expect Levert to struggle a few games, and look for an unexpected contributor to step up while the defense focuses on him (Crawford maybe?). There's also the issue of how to stop Toronto in transition. The Raptors are almost unbeatable when they can get on the break and score easy baskets. Brooklyn ranked 24th in turnovers for the entire regular season, but since the restart, they've ranked 5th out of 21 teams, only turning over the ball 13.3 times a game. Taking care of the ball is a must against Toronto. I do believe in my heart that Toronto has a serious opportunity to make the finals again, and that they won't take this Nets team too lightly, despite the team missing so much key players.

##### Prediction : Raptors in 5 



### (3)Boston Celtics vs (6)Philadelphia 76ers

 {{< figure src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/c_fill,g_auto,f_auto,h_2133,w_3200/https%3A%2F%2Fthesixersense.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fgetty-images%2F2017%2F07%2F1193636811.jpeg">}}



It's almost night and day between how this Celtic team looks compared to the team from last year (I wonder why?). Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are both having career years (both averaging 20+ points), Gordon Hayward looks back to form and they're getting production from their role players on a nightly basis. Boston is currently the only East contender that ranks [both](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/2020.html) top 5 in defensive and offensive rating. Getting Kemba back for the start of the playoffs is huge, and if they could get past Philly, he should have enough games under his belt for a tougher matchup in the semis. They went 5-3 in the bubble and Kemba had some pretty good flashes. If he's healthy, then Boston will be a problem.

Philly isn't in as good of a position. They basically underachieved the entire season, finishing sixth in the East standings heading into the bubble, where they went 4-4 the rest of the way. The roster is still a clunky fit, and adding Al Horford has only made things worse. They're still a solid enough defensive team (ranked 8th), but figuring out how to make the offense work for their best players has been a problem all year. To add to that, Ben Simmons went down with an inury three games into the bubble, which means their fate rests in the hands of Joel Embiid, who has all the tools to be the best player in the NBA, but has yet to show it consistently.

Injuries aside, I think this is going to be the most entertaining East matchup of the first round. On paper, many would say, this should be an easy 5-6 game series for the Celts, especially if Simmons cant play. And losing Simmons will hurt in some areas (he was their best perimeter defender, led the league in steals, and allowed them to push the pace and score in transition). Look at the other side of it though. No Simmons allows Embiid to share the court with four shooters, something that he's rarely had the opportunity to ever do. It will open up the floor for him in ways that he hasn't yet experienced. To add to that, Celtics have one of the smallest frontcourt rotations in the league with Daniel Theis and Jayson Tatum both being listed as 6'8. Embiid is a legit 7 footer. Combine that with Horford, who's played Center most of his career, and Philly should have a pretty big advantage inside. I really would love to go with the upset pick here. But with Embiid not being fully healthy, I think that's enough to give Boston an edge.


##### Prediction : Celtics in 7


### (4)Indiana Pacers vs (5)Miami Heat

 {{< figure src="https://heatnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/USATSI_14724619_168386351_lowres-e1597338079940.jpg">}}


Indiana enters the playoffs as one of the hottest teams in the bubble, going 6-2 since the restart. Big reason for that is TJ Warren, who's looked like the second coming of Michael Jordan. He's averaging 31 points in Orlando, 3rd most behind Dame and James Harden. If he continues to score at that rate, he'll be a problem for the Heat defense. Injuries will play a role for them, as they are missing their second leading scorer in Sabonis (18.5 ppg/12.4 rpg) and another key role player in Jeremy Lamb (12.5 ppg). Good news for them is Oladipo is back playing and although he hasn't looked like his old self yet, he's going to have the opportunity to prove that he can get there.

Injuries also weren't on the Heat's side. Jimmmy Butler and Goran Dragic both missed time in the bubble due to injuries. Now it looks like Derrick Jones Jr will also miss time after a scary injury the other night. But Jimmy will be ready to go come playoff time. And they still have Bam Adebayo balling in the midst of a breakout season (averaging 16/10/5). Tyler Herro has also come on strong as of late, averaging 17 points in 8 bubble games. Overall, the team is a talented group of gritty players that all seem to be clicking at the right time.

The matchup that everybody will be looking forward to of course is Warren vs Jimmy. Those two have had words in the past and Warren's worst game in the bubble came at the expense of Miami (he shot 5-14 and they got ran out of the gym). Prior to that, Miami also won the first three meetings that the teams faced off during the season. It will be interesting to see how Oladipo looks, and if he's playing up to form, this series could get interesting. But Miami has multiple bodies that they can throw at both Oladipo and Warren (Jimmy, Jae Crowder, Andre Igoudala, Jones) to make them work for every point they get. Not to mention they are second in 3-point percentage in the entire NBA, thanks to their [efficient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9I3lS6fV0Y) offense and the sweet shooting stroke of Duncan Robinson (the best shooter in the NBA not named Steph and Klay). I expect the Pacers to try and make this a series, but I believe injuries as well as the overall depth and discipline in Miami will make them the favorites.


##### Prediction: Heat in 6
