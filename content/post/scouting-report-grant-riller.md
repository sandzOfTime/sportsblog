With every new rookie class, there are always a group of players (or player), that has GM's around the league scratching their head, as to how teams managed to let him drop so far. The 2020 draft class will be no exception.
<!--more--> 
In year's past, we've seen guys like Kyle Kuzma(2017), Malcolm Brogdon(2016), Montrez Harrell and Josh Richardson(2015) become these types of players and peform at a higher level than most players drafted before them. It's no surprise that a big factor in a lot of these guys falling in the draft is age: 3rd or 4th year guys are seen as "old" and "lacking potential" compared to younger freshman guys drafted near the top. But I'm a big believer that if a guy can play, then he can play, regardless of age. It's why I feel that Grant Riller has a chance to be the biggest steal, or one of the biggest steals out of this draft class. For those unfamiliar with him, Riller is a 6'3 senior combo guard, out of the College of Charleston.  He's an insanely talented scorer and probably the best in this class. But most mock drafts don't think that highly of him.

Nbadraft.net has him selected at [49th](https://www.nbadraft.net/nba-mock-drafts/) in their mock draft, Tankathon has him slotted at [44th](http://www.tankathon.com/mock_draft) and ESPN also has him in the second round at [39th](https://www.espn.com/nba/draft/bestavailable/_/position/ovr/page/2). In my opinion, these rankings are too low and Riller deserves strong consideration for a lottery pick. Of course, there are two main drawbacks as to why this probably won't happen. One is the age factor. Riller will be 23 when his name is called on draft night. There are a few success stories with guys that were drafted at that age (Buddy Hield, Devonte Graham, Brogdon), but alot of other guys that didn't pan out (Frank Mason, Adriene Payne, CJ Wilcox, Cleanthony Early etc). Secondly, he played at a mid major school and even though there has been less nitpicking over the years with guys who have played a that level (Ja Morant was just taken #2 last year), there is a steep drop in competition compared to conferences such as the ACC, Big East and Big Ten to name a few.

With that being said, if teams can look past these factors, they could walk away with a pretty talented player wherever he falls. Here are the most important things that I observed while watching Riller:


### He's a certified bucket

As far as the scoring goes, Riller has no holes in his game. He's a three level scorer that can put the ball in the basket in a variety of ways. For his career, Riller averages 19 a game on 62 [TS%](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/grant-riller-1.html#all_players_advanced)(that's very good in case you are wondering). This past season, he led the team in scoring with 22 a game(which ranked second in the [conference](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/conferences/colonial/2020-leaders.html)), along with 5 rebounds and 4 assists. But it's his scoring game that makes him so dangerous. Let's start with his finishing ability in which he's one of the [best](https://www.thestepien.com/2020/02/20/grant-riller-scouting-report/) at it in this class. He's extremely good at finishing around the basket, with or without contact. Check out this play below.

He shows amazing touch right here on this off balanced floater while taking the contact and still finishing. These types of shots are difficult to make, but it takes a high degree of skill to even get some of these off. 

His finishing ability is complimented by how well he gets to the rim. He has an elite first step, and its easy to see him blow by defenders on a regular basis. On top of that, he dribbles the ball on a string. His ball handling is one of the best in the class (arguably second behind Lamelo), and he uses it to get to wherever he wants to on the floor. Watch how he's able to get to the rim on this play.

On this play, he uses a nice behind the back dribble to change direction, and then slightly freezes the defender with a mini hesitation that allows him to get to the basket for another floater. Again, its his ability to manipulate defenders with his handle that allows him to get to spots all over the floor. Because of this, and his quick first step, I expect him to get to the rim frequently at the next level while being able to finish his fair share of plays.

 He also has a very good mid-range game. Riller uses an array of step-backs, side-steps and hesitation pull-ups to get shots off against defenders in almost any scenario. One on one in iso situations, he's a nightmare to guard on that level as he can beat you in so many different ways. Watch how he is able to use his handle to set up his defender for the shot.

<br>

Riller is able to lull his defender to sleep with a few light dribbles, then breaks out a stutter-step hesitation that freezes the defender just enough to rise and fire for the pull-up. What I personally love about this play is that everything is in rhythm; his pace is nice and steady and he's not being rushed to make a play by the defense. These are all good traits of a professional scorer.

Another example of that would be the play below. Watch how he is able to get the separation needed to get his shot off against a bigger defender.

<br>

<br>

On this play, Riller sizes up his defender after catching the ball in the mid-post, and makes a hard dribble left before hitting his defender with a step back jumper. The space he creates after the step-back is really quite impressive, and from the looks of it, he needed every bit of it to get proper separation from the defense.



His 3-point shot is pretty good but not great. For his [career](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/grant-riller-1.html), he's shooting 36% from long range which is above average. But he only averaged 4 attempts per game from distance during his senior season. For comparison, Damian Lillard averaged 7 attempts and Steph Curry averaged 10!(more on those two players later). With the way the game is trending, it's surprising that he hasn't attempted more. There is proof than he can make some really tough ones.

Of course, he's not as good of a shooter as Steph or Dame. But a lot of his progress will depend on how willing he is to take those kinds of shots.



### He's an improving passer, but he still has a ways to go

Despite his size and frame, Riller isn't necessarily a point guard. He has a score first mindset, and it shows up in the way he plays. Despite that he's made improvements since he first arrived at Charleston.  For his career, he's averaged 2.8 assists per [game](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/grant-riller-1.html). Obviously not a lot, but from his sophomore to junior year, the figure basically doubled from 2 to 4. It's only a small improvement, and the numbers don't look good when compared to some other guards in this class. But not every guard is possessed with great vision or natural passing instincts. In Riller's case, finding the balance between getting his own shot and making a play for someone else has been his biggest development. Great scorers truly become great players when they learn how to fully use their scoring gifts to free up opportunities for their teammates.  And that's exactly what has allowed him to improve in this area. Take a look at this play below for instance.

Here Riller is attacking the rim with the intention to score. That's important. He's not pre-determining his moves or deciding before hand that he's gonna pass the ball. Instead, he's putting himself in position to put the ball in the basket, but reacting to the collapsing defense. The hop-step slows the game down and gives him enough time to survey where the help defense is coming from, allowing him to make the kick out pass to the wide open man in the corner. His teammate didn't hit the shot, but this is as good of a look as the offense could have hoped for. Here's another play that although not as aggressive as the first, still accomplishes the same thing.
