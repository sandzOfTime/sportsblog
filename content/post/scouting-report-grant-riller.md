With every incoming rookie class, there is always a player that has GM's around the league scratching their head, as to how they let him slide so far in the draft. Expect a lot of the same this year.
<!--more--> 
In year's past, we've seen guys like Kyle Kuzma(2017), Malcolm Brogdon(2016), Montrez Harrell and Josh Richardson(2015) become these types of players and perform at a higher level than a lot of players selected before them. A big factor in all of that? Age. 3rd or 4th year guys are often seen as "old" and "lacking po-ential" compared to younger freshman guys drafted near the top. But I'm a big believer that if a guy can play, then he can play, regardless of age. It's why I feel that Grant Riller has a chance to be the biggest steal, or one of the biggest steals out of this draft class. For those unfamiliar with him, Riller is a 6'3 senior combo guard, out of the College of Charleston.  He's an insanely talented scorer and probably the best in this class. But most mock drafts don't think that highly of him.

Nbadraft.net has him selected at [49th](https://www.nbadraft.net/nba-mock-drafts/) in their mock draft, Tankathon has him slotted at [44th](http://www.tankathon.com/mock_draft) and ESPN also has him in the second round at [39th](https://www.espn.com/nba/draft/bestavailable/_/position/ovr/page/2). In my opinion, these rankings are way too low and Riller deserves strong consideration for a lottery pick. However, there are two main drawbacks as to why this probably won't happen. One is the age factor. Riller will be 23 when his name is called on draft night. There are a few success stories with guys that were drafted at that age (Buddy Hield, Devonte Graham, Brogdon), but a lot of other guys that didn't pan out (Frank Mason, Adriene Payne, CJ Wilcox, Cleanthony Early etc, just to name a few). Secondly, he played at a mid major school and even though there has been less nitpicking over the last few years with guys who have played at that level (Ja Morant was taken #2 just last year), there is a steep drop in competition compared to conferences such as the ACC, Big East and Big Ten to name a few.

Even with that being said though, if teams can look past these issues, they could walk away with a pretty talented player wherever he falls. Here are some things that caught my eye while watching Riller:


### He's a certified bucket

As far as scoring goes, Riller has no holes in his game. He's a three level scorer that can put the ball in the basket in a multitude of ways. For his career, Riller averaged 19 a game on 62 [TS%](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/grant-riller-1.html#all_players_advanced)(that's very good in case you are wondering). This past season, he led the team in scoring with 22 a game(which ranked second in the [conference](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/conferences/colonial/2020-leaders.html)), along with 5 rebounds and 4 assists. But his bread and butter is putting the ball in the hole, and that's what makes him so dangerous. Let's start with his finishing ability in which he's one of the [best](https://www.thestepien.com/2020/02/20/grant-riller-scouting-report/) at it in this class. He's extremely good at finishing around the basket, with or without contact. Check out this play below.

<br>

{{< youtube id="yemKh-J51G0" >}}

<br>

He shows amazing touch right here on this off balanced floater while taking the contact and still finishing. These types of shots are difficult to make, but it takes a high degree of skill to even get some of these off. 

His finishing ability is complimented by how well he gets to the rim. He has an elite first step, and its easy to see him blow by defenders on a regular basis. On top of that, he has the ball on a string whenever he dribbles. His ball handling is one of the best in the class (arguably second behind Lamelo), and he uses it to get wherever he wants to on the floor. Watch how he's able to get to the rim on this play.

<br>

{{< youtube id="Bkfbs46R2So" >}}

<br>

On this play, he uses a nice behind the back dribble to change direction, and then slightly freezes the defender with a mini hesitation that allows him to get to the basket for another floater. Again, its his ability to manipulate defenders with his handle that allows him to get to spots all over the floor. Because of this, and his quick first step, he's going to get to the rim frequently at the next level while being able to finish his fair share of plays.

 He also has a very good mid-range game. Riller uses an array of step-backs, side-steps and hesitation pull-ups to get shots off against defenders in almost any scenario. One-on-one in iso situations, he's a nightmare to guard as he can beat you in so many different ways. Watch how he is able to use his handle to set up his defender for this shot.

<br>

{{< youtube id="T3NZL5RLjK8" >}}

<br>

Riller is able to lull his defender to sleep with a few light dribbles, then breaks out a stutter-step hesitation that freezes the defender just enough to rise and fire for the pull-up. What I really love about this play is that everything is in rhythm; his pace is nice and steady and he's not letting the defense dictate his movements. These are all good traits of a professional bucket getter.

Another example of that would be the play below. Watch how he is able to get the separation needed to get his shot off against a bigger defender.

<br>

{{< youtube id="O44q0gtOKz4" >}}

<br>

On this play, Riller sizes up his defender after catching the ball in the mid-post, and makes a hard dribble left before hitting his defender with a step back jumper. The space he creates after the step-back is really something else, and from the looks of it, he needed every bit of it to get good separation from the defense.



His 3-point shot is pretty good but not great. For his [career](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/grant-riller-1.html), he's shooting 36% from long range which is above average. But he only averaged 4 attempts per game from distance during his senior season. For comparison, Damian Lillard averaged 7 attempts and Steph Curry averaged 10!(more on those two players later). With the direction the game is trending towards today, it's surprising that he hasn't attempted more. There is proof than he can make some really tough ones.

<br>



Of course, he's not as good of a shooter as Steph or Dame. But a lot of his progress will depend on how willing he is to take those kinds of shots.



### He's an improving passer, but he still has a ways to go

Although he's only standing 6'3, Riller isn't necessarily a point guard. He has a score first mindset, and it shows up in the way he plays. Despite that, he's made improvements since he first arrived at Charleston.  For his career, he's averaged 2.8 assists per [game](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/grant-riller-1.html). Obviously not a lot, but from his sophomore to junior year, the figure basically doubled from 2 to 4. It's only a small improvement, and the numbers don't look good when compared to some other guards in this class. But not every guard is possessed with great vision or natural passing instincts. In Riller's case, finding the balance between getting his own shot and making a play for someone else has been his biggest development. Great scorers truly become great players when they learn how to fully use their scoring gifts to free up opportunities for their teammates.  And that's exactly what has allowed him to improve in this area. Take a look at this play below for instance.



<br>

{{< youtube id="SzD5ThCBPIM" >}}

<br>

Here Riller is attacking the rim with the intention to score. That's important. He's not pre-determining his moves or deciding before hand that he's going to make a pass. Instead, he's putting himself in position to score, but reacting to the defense around him. The hop-step slows the game down for him and gives him enough time to survey where the help defense is coming from, allowing him to make the kick out pass to the wide open man in the corner. His teammate didn't hit the shot, but this is as good of a look as the offense could have hoped for. Here's another play that although not as aggressive as the first, still accomplishes the same thing.



<br>

{{< youtube id="lF7raPXJnIk" >}}

<br>


Riller isn't able to get all the way to the rim on this play, so it's tough to say that his intent was really to score. But the process is basically the same; be aggressive, draw in help defenders, then find a way to get the ball to the open man. By rejecting the screen and making an aggressive play to get to the basket, Riller drew in two defenders. After that, the only issue was picking the best way to get the ball to an open teammate (behind the back pass). These types of plays are the kinds that you wanna see more of when Riller gets to the next level.



There is still room to improve though. The balance between being a scorer and a facilitator is still just a balance. And that doesn't mean that it will be equal on both sides. Riller still struggles sometimes with forcing plays instead of giving up the ball to generate an easier shot. One example is below.



<br>

{{< youtube id="LuzPxvA24N4" >}}

<br>



To be fair to him, Riller did end up drawing a blocking foul on this play. Despite that though, I felt that he could have gotten an open shot by kicking it to the strong-side corner. Plays like these could easily result in a charging call, or some other turnover at the next level. He's also prone to making careless passes and reads in general at times, as seen below.

<br>

{{< youtube id="xL13GULeenA" >}}

<br>



During his last season in college, Riller averaged 3.4 turnovers to go with his 4.2 assists, not a good ratio for an NBA point guard. To maximize his potential and be the best player possible, he's gonna have to find a way to limit some careless mistakes and turnovers and continue to grow by using his scoring ability to make the game easier for other players.




### He plays lazy at times, but has tools to be a good defender

Like most super talented scorers, Riller has trouble staying engaged defensively.  Part of the reason is probably the fact that he carries so much responsibility offensively, and that he may not have enough energy to lock up on defense. Whatever it is, it's gonna be a problem at the next level if he doesn't fix it. As good as he is on offense, he probably won't be a dominant scorer from day one. That means he's going to have to be a better defender to not only stay on the floor, but also to play in key minutes. It starts with giving more effort. Riller sometimes defends like he's just going through the routine/motions. He isn't always in the proper stance, lazily bites at pump fakes and doesn't make an attempt to recover when dudes blow by him. Below you can see some examples of what I mean (via [Zach Milner]([https://twitter.com/ZachMilner13?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor](https://twitter.com/ZachMilner13?ref_src=twsrc^google|twcamp^serp|twgr^author)))



<br>

<br>

Despite all of that, Riller has shown some very real flashes on that end to prove that he can be a good defender in the league if he's locked in. Physically, he's very strong with quick hands. He also slides his feet very well when guarding on ball and has good timing on strips and deflections. Here is an example of that.



<br>

{{< youtube id="kn0g22V0VwA" >}}

<br>


You could argue whether or not that was a foul. But he displayed good lateral quickness to stay in front of his man, along with the right timing to strip the ball before he made his move. The no-look pass on the fast break was just the icing on the cake of a good defensive possession. 



<br>

{{< youtube id="zoUr1Mrwel8" >}}

<br>


This one above was probably the most impressive defensive play that I've seen from him, and it's what makes me a believer that he can be pretty good defensively in the NBA. He was able to evade both screens and use his athleticism to intercept the pass mid-air. He read the play to perfection, something I don't think a guy with a low IQ on that end could make.

By no means, am I saying that he's a lock to be good defensively based on a few highlight plays. But, I do feel that these plays show someone who not only has the physical tools, but the mental capacity to be an effective defender consistently. The challenge for whatever team that picks him will be how to push the right buttons, so that his effort level stays consistent with what he's capable of doing.





### What to expect in the NBA?

If you take a look at some of the guards that have [matched](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&class_is_fr=Y&class_is_so=Y&class_is_jr=Y&class_is_sr=Y&pos_is_g=Y&games_type=A&qual=pts_per_g&c1stat=ts_pct&c1comp=gt&c1val=60&c2stat=usg_pct&c2comp=gt&c2val=30&c3stat=stl_pct&c3comp=gt&c3val=2&order_by=pts) or exceeded Grant Riller's efficiency and usage while in college, you'll see he's in the likes of some pretty good company (Damian Lillard, Stephen Curry, Ja Morant etc.) Is that me saying he's going to be as good as any of those players? No. There's probably a higher chance that he ends up as the other familiar name on that list that didn't last long in the league(Jimmer). But context is important. I'm not saying Riller should go top 2. But for a guy this talented, anything less than the first round is an insult. In my opinion, he should be one of the first 14 names called on draft night. And you can honestly make a good case for selecting him over just about every point guard not named Lamelo or Killian.

As for what to expect, I think he'll be a really good scorer for any team from day one. He's too talented on that end of the floor for his strengths not to translate. If he doesn't improve much, I expect him to be a sixth man type of player, capable of carrying an offense in stretches and setting up teammates based on the amount of attention that he draws. But he can really develop into a legit starting point guard if he focuses on continuing to improve his passing/decision making, committing to the defensive side of the ball more consistently and unlocking his insane shotmaking potential (taking more threes).

Watching Riller at the collegiate level, I saw a guy that knew most nights that he was the clear cut best player on the floor. And I honestly feel that he became bored; knowing that he could dominate on most nights without having to give his all. I'm hoping that an increased level of competition will push him to dial up his intensity consistently and that he'll continue to improve once he steps foot on an NBA floor.
